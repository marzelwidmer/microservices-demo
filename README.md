```
oc logs -f bc/movie-catalog-service
```

## Webhooks
After creating a BuildConfig` from a GitHub repository, run:

```
oc describe bc/movie-catalog-service
```

This will output a webhook GitHub URL that looks like:
``` 
https://console.c3smonkey.ch:8443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/development/buildconfigs/movie-catalog-service/webhooks/<secret>/github
```
Cut and paste this URL into GitHub, from the GitHub web console.
In your GitHub repository, select Add Webhook from Settings â†’ Webhooks.
Paste the URL output (similar to above) into the Payload URL field.

Hint: `SSL Disable (not recommended)` if your cluster don't have a valid SSL certificate.
```
SSL verification
 By default, we verify SSL certificates when delivering payloads.
